# JBWordCount

This is an old program I wrote as a high schooler, archived here for my own amusement. I had written a [choose-your-own-adventure story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebook) and wanted to test my hypothesis that the sections got steadily longer over time. So I wrote this program to generate a chart of each section's word count.

The final result: <http://imgur.com/a/K5Xhd>

The final result including one unusually long novella-size section: <http://imgur.com/a/6i7Ue>

The files in the repository are just my code, without the text files of my CYOA or JFreeChart that it depends on.
